 <br>In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. It's meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary allies that join your party.<br>Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with this tag.<br>
You are limited to 2 companion slots.<br>
Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same initiative (rolled by you).<br>
Companions gain bonuses or penalties based off of your CHA.

 <br>This game is played turn-based, with turn order determined at the start of the battle with an Initiative roll. The actions you can take on your turn are as follows.<br>
<br>
Standard Action: This action occupies most of your turn, and you can perform one per turn.

<br>Example: The Attack Action is the most common, allowing a series of smaller attacks up to your Attack Speed, executed in any order. Refer to the "Attack" section for more details.<br>



<br>
Swift Action: This action can be executed during any other action, with a limit of one per turn.

<br>
Free Action: These actions are effortless or part of other actions, allowing you to perform as many as you wish per turn - within reason.

<br>
Full-Round Action: This action requires the use of your standard action and all of your free movement. You may still move if you have an ability that allows extra movement as a different action.<br>


<br>When it's not your turn, you can take the following actions:<br>
<br>
Immediate Action: A Swift Action that can occur off-turn. Limited to one per round, shared with Swift Action — you cannot use both in the same round.

<br>
Instant Action: A Free Action that can occur off-turn. Referred to as "Instantly" in abilities.

<br>Attack of Opportunity (AoO): A response triggered by certain actions of others. Limited to one per round. When a creature "Provokes," they are engaging in an action that allows others to AoO them.

ACC - Accuracy<br>
HP - Hit Points<br>
LV - LevelAbbreviations<br>Charisma (CHA): Your leadership and personal magnetism.<br>
Positive charisma enhances your companion creatures. Any creature that takes a companion slot gains your CHA to their Accuracy and Avoidability.
<br>
You lose a companion slot with negative CHA.
<br>
Negative CHA reduces your companion's Accuracy and Avoidability.
CHA<br><br>Dexterity (DEX): Your agility, hand-eye coordination, and general sneakiness.<br>
You add DEX to your Reflex Save. 
You add your DEX to your Accuracy and Avoidability. 
You add DEX to Initiative.
<br>
Every point of DEX adds +5 to your speed and jump.
<br>
Negative DEX subtracts from these values.
DEX<br><br>Intelligence (INT): Your knowledge, magical expertise, and logic capacity.<br>
You add INT to Spell Power and Mana
<br>
You gain an additional skill proficiency per point of intelligence
<br>
You gain two additional languages per point of INT (listed in the skills section under linguistics)
<br>
Negative INT subtracts from Spell Power and Mana &gt;You lose a skill proficiency per negative INT
INT<br><br>Luck (LUK): Your ability to turn tides and benefit from unlikely outcomes.<br>
You add LUK to Avoid. 
You add LUK to Potency. 
You add LUK to Luck Checks. 
You add LUK to Critical Damage.
<br>
You can add LUK to a roll as an Immediate Action (that did not already add LUK).
<br>
Negative LUK subtracts from Avoid, Potency, Luck Checks, and Critical Damage.
LUK<br><br>Wisdom (WIS): Your faith, decision making, habits, diligence, and discipline.<br>
You add WIS to your <a data-href="Will" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\Will" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Will</a> Save.<br>
You gain 50% more <a data-href="XP" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\XP" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">XP</a> per point of WIS.<br>
You gain a <a data-href="Feat" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\Feat" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Feat</a> per Wisdom. 
<br>
Negative WIS subtracts from your Will Save, Feats, and reduces your XP gain to 50%.
Wisdom<br><br>Strength (STR): Your fortitude, athleticism, and endurance.<br>
You add STR to your Fortitude Save.<br>
You add STR to physical attacks, such as with weapons and unarmed attacks.<br>
When you wield a weapon in two hands, you add twice your STR to damage.
<br>
You add STR to combat maneuver checks.
<br>
Every point of STR increases your carry weight by 50%.
<br>
Negative STR subtracts from your Fortitude Saves.<br>
Negative STR halves your Carry Weight.
STR<br><br>A creature's Carry Weight represents what it is capable of lifting and moving around with without much effort.<br>The default value is 100, but some factors may change this.<br>A creature can lift and drag twice as much as their carry weight, but is staggered while doing so.<br>Carry Weight<br>When the chance something will happen or fail to happen is based purely on chance, you attempt a Luck Check. You just roll a d10, add (or subtract) LUK and compare the result on the die to the DC.Luck Check<br>In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. It's meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary allies that join your party.<br>Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with this tag.<br>
You are limited to 2 companion slots.<br>
Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same initiative (rolled by you).<br>
Companions gain bonuses or penalties based off of your CHA.
