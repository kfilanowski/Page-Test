 <br>In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. It's meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary allies that join your party.<br>Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with this tag.<br>
You are limited to 2 companion slots.<br>
Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same initiative (rolled by you).<br>
Companions gain bonuses or penalties based off of your CHA.

 <br>This game is played turn-based, with turn order determined at the start of the battle with an Initiative roll. The actions you can take on your turn are as follows.<br>
<br>
Standard Action: This action occupies most of your turn, and you can perform one per turn.

<br>Example: The Attack Action is the most common, allowing a series of smaller attacks up to your Attack Speed, executed in any order. Refer to the "Attack" section for more details.<br>



<br>
Swift Action: This action can be executed during any other action, with a limit of one per turn.

<br>
Free Action: These actions are effortless or part of other actions, allowing you to perform as many as you wish per turn - within reason.

<br>
Full-Round Action: This action requires the use of your standard action and all of your free movement. You may still move if you have an ability that allows extra movement as a different action.<br>


<br>When it's not your turn, you can take the following actions:<br>
<br>
Immediate Action: A Swift Action that can occur off-turn. Limited to one per round, shared with Swift Action — you cannot use both in the same round.

<br>
Instant Action: A Free Action that can occur off-turn. Referred to as "Instantly" in abilities.

<br>Attack of Opportunity (AoO): A response triggered by certain actions of others. Limited to one per round. When a creature "Provokes," they are engaging in an action that allows others to AoO them.

 <br>Malon's Marvelous Misadventures is a TTRPG where the players take on the roles of capable adventurers in a fantasy world, facing off against the odds themselves as they plow through hordes and chow down on the rewards! It's centered on systems that maximize the ease of content creation and compatibility with what exists in other tactical TTRPGs.<br>The content provided will be enough to run relatively lighthearted fantasy games, and serves as a basis to create more and adapt it to your needs. The game mechanics are a blend of real-world intuition and game-y themes, setting a stage with a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief to allow more creative solutions to problems without worrying too much about adherence to realism.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\🍔-mission-statement.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">🍔 Mission Statement.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 10:41:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome]]></title><description><![CDATA[
